Almost every Java programmer recommends to read book 
"Thinking in Java". So a few days ago I decided to 
learn Java from scratch through this book.

I need to understand all Java mechanics and teach myself 
to write code in Java without modern IDE using 'simple ' text 
editor. I've chosen Vim with some plugins as text editor 
(maybe later I will write post about my vim settings).

So I will read this book from cover to cover with huge 
attention and do all exercises (even those which are very-very 
simple) using vim and terminal (like a true geek).

Later I will write my opinion and impression about "Thinking 
in Java". But all I can say for now is that it has another 
approach comparing to "HeadFirst Java", which is 
written like for children.
